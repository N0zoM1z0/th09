# TH09 reconstruction handoff

## Active objective

The user resumed on **2026-10-09**: reach **95% exact reviewed-authored bytes**,
work on large functions, use direct IDA Pro MCP and local Bash/compiler Oracles
without Factory MCP, commit locally as `gpt-6.1-sol: ...`, and do not push.
Batch coherent trials before cold replay; reuse unchanged baselines only after
checking their source/backend/object bindings. The goal remains active-incomplete.
The October 7 stop at 7347cb3 is historical.

This checkpoint starts clean at 69fed0a. Target SHA, direct IDA metadata, entry
and five distributed mapped-byte samples pass. No target patch, IDA write or
delegation. Four complete GameplaySetupThread helper-visibility controls are
compiled once each and rejected after complete target/carrier inspection and
batch-end strict sibling replay. No canonical source, ABI, profile, match row
or exactness credit changes. Prior source corrections remain maintained.

## Live ledger snapshot

These totals are checked against the live ledgers by scripts/validate-docs.py.

| Measure | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Function candidates | 2,192 |
| Boundary/origin unreviewed | 0 |
| Reviewed but origin-unresolved | 35 |
| Confirmed authored | 980 |
| Classified exclusions | 1,177 |
| Source-present authored mappings | 980 |
| Canonical exact functions | 928 |
| Source-present non-exact functions | 52 |
| Source-present non-exact bytes | 57,269 |
| Authored without maintained source | 0 |
| Canonical exact authored bytes | 218,501 |

The fixed authored denominator is **275,770 bytes**: **79.2331%** exact.
Another **43,481 bytes** are needed for 95%. Origin-unresolved candidates are
separate. Faithful Windows i386 product/runtime gates remain open;
semantic reconstruction and portability have not started.

## Active frontiers

- RunEcl: 14,792 target code /15,564 physical bytes; candidate has
  **14,791 code + one alignment + 772 compiler-table bytes**. All 598 fields
  are independently checked, with 2,161 complete differences. Handler frontiers
  remain 4/7/86/155/156/157; scope controls recorded in the KB are rejected.
- Enemy OnUpdate: 3,883 authored /3,900 physical bytes, 97 fields, 39 differences;
  early draw index, descriptor/effect scheduling, trail and homing.
- Gameplay setup worker: 1,689 bytes, 171 fields, 921 full differences; reuse-base
  caching, flags cursor and rate/failure-tail topology remain open.
- GameManager update: 1,230 bytes, 87 fields, 105 differences; input capture and
  entry-zero scheduling, plus six shifted early-return branch displacements.
- Title Options: 2,045 target /2,048 candidate bytes, 135 fields, 610 linked
  overlap differences plus three excess; 51 calls and 121 direct blocks agree.
- Player movement: 1,835 authored /1,900 physical bytes, 66 fields, 144 differences.
- Player charge: 1,210 target /1,197 candidate bytes, 70 fields, 1,160 linked
  overlap differences plus 13 absent. Integer conversion preserves seven regions
  and 58 ordered calls; entry register allocation and byte-mode storage are open.
- Enemy draw: 1,758 bytes, four differences around the second subtraction/Abs.
- Type21 update: 1,074 bytes, 29 fields, 15 ring-preheader differences; actual
  descriptor member storage is maintained. Entry-owner-path controls are neutral.
- Remaining owners, including ExAttack18/24, PauseMenu and DirectPlay, are routed
  by config/functions.csv and docs/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md. Read prior controls first.

## Latest gameplay worker batch

Packet: `.analysis/gpt-6.1-sol-gameplay-helper-visibility-20261009/`.
All 92 inherited source/header/backend inputs agree with the actual baseline
`build/gpt-dots-setup-continuations-20261006/baseline.obj`, SHA256
`c181cf0b14561687ddf6ba9975ebce492bdfb25d055ea5269183fba608f7e186`.
No unchanged baseline or canonical compile; no candidate adoption.

Two controls omit the unchanged AdvanceTimedState definition, or that definition
plus ResetGameManager and FormatCurrentDateString. All remaining owners are fully
neutral; removed literals have consumers only in omitted definitions. The complete
worker source, declarations and call contracts stay intact. All seven/five present
same-profile exact siblings strictly replay 1,034/889 bytes and 88/84 fields;
omitted helpers remain independently exact in the real unchanged baseline.

Two further controls expose the actual canonical opponent-selection declaration,
then its unchanged implementation, using the same GameManager root at its four
calls. Only the four call-symbol spellings change, at independently identical
0x415910 destinations and field offsets/types/addends. A copied mode header drops
only its unused conflicting extern declaration; setup's actual declaration stays.
All twelve previous raw bodies/effective fields are neutral; eight exact siblings
replay 1,122 bytes/96 fields. The extra helper emits 735/799 bytes under the worker's
fixed /Os profile, versus its canonical non-/Os profile. No TU/profile migration.

All four complete workers remain **1,689 bytes /171 fields /921 differences**,
with 416 candidate versus 413 target instructions, 77 versus 78 blocks and all
33 direct/two IAT-cell call operands agreeing in order. Current include closures
are 86/86/91/91 paths. Independent COFF/PE and repository parsers agree on every
owner/field. These static/compiler facts do not prove unique original ownership,
native runtime or the whole historical compiler environment.

Complete compressed proof, patches, actual logs, direct IDA windows and recipes
remain. Hash-checked cleanup removes fifteen owned source/COFF/PDB files,
**853,825 bytes**. `prepare.py --restore` then `opponent.py --restore` reproduces
all seven copies without compiling, checked after cleanup. Retained-only audit
rebinds captured candidate bytes to the real target and checks the actual baseline,
current inputs and exact source inverses. Deleted COFFs are not re-inspected.
These precise visibility combinations are rejected; seek different evidence or
another large owner, rather than repeating them unchanged.

## Other current evidence

- GameManager update arrays: `.analysis/gpt-6.1-sol-setup-input-array-20261009/`;
  explicit publication is neutral, two-side loop regresses; see KB.
- Latest flat ECL scope controls: `.analysis/gpt-6.1-sol-ecl-flat-local-scope-20261009/`;
  all 67 owners and 23 exact siblings are neutral. See KB for precise exclusions.
- Prior ECL mutation controls and code-extent correction:
  `.analysis/gpt-6.1-sol-ecl-mutation-expressions-20261009/`. Its precise direct
  timeout/comma-jump/opcode-snapshot controls are neutral. Decoder tests remain.
- Type21 canonical-only proof checks all 23 ECL exact siblings and the actual
  67-owner carrier. No need to rebuild unchanged historical cohorts.
- Charge conversion: `.analysis/gpt-6.1-sol-charge-timer-conversion-20261009/`;
  current carrier `build/gpt-6.1-sol-charge-timer-conversion-20261009/canonical.obj`,
  SHA256 `4744bb7c52cce4a50b55aa7162578ce79f9cf613b56e9e454f0cc3bb1df4971d`.
  Existing timer conversion replaces the private getter overlay; complete code
  and effective fields remain unchanged. Original folded spelling is unknown.
- Options: `.analysis/gpt-6.1-sol-options-index-dispatch-20261009/`; unsigned
  selectors, index reuse and real right-input switch are neutral. Current cache
  `build/matching/TitleScreenOptions.obj` remains hash-bound by its retained audit.

Call direct IDA get_metadata with exactly {} during entry attestation. Complete
RunEcl inspection returns 1 for expected differences. Full candidate replay requires
rebuilt objects and a fresh trial manifest; retained-only replay verifies captured
proof. Earlier compact evidence and source corrections remain in the KB and Git.

Validation: complete carrier/target proof, strict affected siblings, tracking,
progress, isolated CI and whitespace pass. CI runs 79 tests: 68 pass and eleven
optional Capstone checks skip. Local checkpoints are not pushed. The 95% objective
and native product/runtime/later phase gates remain open.
